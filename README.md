Requires [Immersive Portals](https://github.com/qouteall/ImmersivePortalsMod) [v0.88-1.16](https://github.com/qouteall/ImmersivePortalsMod/releases/tag/v0.88-1.16) or greater.

### How to set up a portal:

1. Pick your locations. I chose two pairs of dark oak trees, a pair in Location A, a dark oak forest, and a pair in Location B, a savanna.![Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4016145/112736004-cfee6080-8f25-11eb-864b-b45f1e3a6160.png)

2. Build a portal frame from crying obsidian at Location A. This will set the size, shape, and orientation of the portals at **both** locations. ![Frame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4016145/112736054-222f8180-8f26-11eb-88fc-b6e0c0d34433.png)

3. Place a lodestone at location B. The lower southeast corner of the portal's bounding box will be placed one block east of the lodestone. In the picture, the red wool represents where I planned for the portal to be placed. The RGB figure in the center of the F3 debug screen shows you which direction is which. The joint of all three lines is toward the lower southeast. If you don't want to use F3, you can use a sunflower or the sun/moon to determine which direction is East. ![Lodestone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4016145/112736197-3922a380-8f27-11eb-8adb-1624e01d452d.png)

4. Right click with a compass on the lodestone to link the compass to the lodestone. Place the compass in your offhand.

5. With a nether star in your main hand and the compass in your off-hand, right click on the inside of the portal frame at Location A. Within a few seconds, your new portal should open, and if it does not, a message will appear in chat that will let you know what went wrong. If the portal does open up, the nether star will be consumed.![Ignite](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4016145/112736279-edbcc500-8f27-11eb-932f-89955edd40cb.png)

6. If you wish, you can now remove both the lodestone and the crying obsidian. The portals will remain in place. I recommend that you place some sort of block in place of the crying obsidian as a frame, as the edges of the portals can look strange. Notice the grass in the picture. ![Border](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4016145/112736339-5f950e80-8f28-11eb-93c2-64f143c8c29e.png)

7. Remember that as the portal appears in the middle of the block space on both ends, any block adjacent to the portal will appear to be split in half. You can embrace the strange half-block astetic, or choose to place the same kind of block on both sides. I chose to get rid of the hard line.![Complete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4016145/112736407-b569b680-8f28-11eb-82af-7db58c7eb99d.png)
