#This is run every tick, so let's make this lightweight. 
#First, we use an experience bottle, as they're not generally thrown around all that much. Second, it checks for items in a very small radius.
#If it finds a TNT item entity less than 2 blocks away, that is TNT and named GateBuster, it will summon a short-lived tagged fireworks rocket. TODO: Change GateBusters to be something more special.
